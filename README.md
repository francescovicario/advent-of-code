# --- Advent Of Code ---

This is my personal take on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about). 

Created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz), Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skills and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.
